# What is Meteor?

Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript platform for developing modern web and mobile applications. Meteor includes a key set of technologies for building connected-client reactive applications, a build tool, and a curated set of packages from the Node.js and general JavaScript community.
Meteor allows you to develop in one language, JavaScript, in all environments: application server, web browser, and mobile device.
Meteor uses data on the wire, meaning the server sends data, not HTML, and the client renders it.
Meteor embraces the ecosystem, bringing the best parts of the extremely active JavaScript community to you in a careful and considered way.
Meteor provides full stack reactivity, allowing your UI to seamlessly reflect the true state of the world with minimal development effort.
